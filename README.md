# MultiLingual-Document-Summarization
## Introduction
Welcome to the project, "MultiLingual-Document-Summarization." Our initiative aims to develop an automated system for multi-document text summarization, covering both English and Arabic languages. Leveraging advanced language models and implementing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic identification, our goal is to enhance cross-cultural information access, improve efficiency, maintain precision, and address the challenges of handling extensive textual data. Ultimately, this project strives to provide a valuable tool for efficient information retrieval and text analysis across diverse linguistic contexts.

## Project Overview
In today's data-driven world, managing and extracting insights from extensive textual information pose significant challenges. The MultiLingual-Document-Summarization repository endeavors to revolutionize the handling of large volumes of text. Our project is dedicated to the development of an advanced system that automates multi-document text summarization in both English and Arabic.

## Key Features:

1. **Cross-Lingual Capability:** Our system supports multi-document summarization in both English and Arabic, facilitating information retrieval across diverse linguistic contexts.

2. **Advanced NLP Techniques:** Leveraging advanced language models, topic modeling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), and other NLP techniques, we aim to achieve high-quality and informative summaries.

3. **Custom Dataset:** We curate our own dataset from diverse sources, ensuring the quality and relevance of the data used for training and evaluation.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:** The system's performance is assessed using established metrics such as ROUGE, BERT Score, BLEU Score, and Fluency to ensure the generation of accurate and coherent summaries.

## Getting Started
To initiate your exploration of the MultiLingual-Document-Summarization Using NLP project on Google Colab, follow these steps:

**Installation**
As this project has been developed in Google Colab, the installation process is streamlined. Simply open the provided Jupyter notebook (IPYNB file) in Google Colab, and the required dependencies will be automatically set up within the Colab environment.

1. **Open in Colab:** Click on the provided IPYNB file link, and it will open directly in Google Colab.

2. **Runtime Configuration:** Ensure that you have a working internet connection and select a Python runtime that supports GPU acceleration for optimal performance.

3. **Download the Data:** Download the english and arabic data from the data folder and upload it to your colab envinirment.

4. **Run All Cells:** Execute the notebook cells sequentially by selecting "Runtime" -> "Run all" from the menu. This will install and configure the necessary dependencies.
